# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Sector

## Aim:
This project aims to develop a robust predictive model for identifying potential customer churn in the telecom industry. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced analytical techniques, we will analyse customer data to predict which customers are most likely to churn. This predictive insight will enable telecom companies to implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing churn rates and increasing customer loyalty.

## Problem Statement:  
The telecom industry faces high customer churn rates due to competitive pricing, better service offerings by competitors, and customer dissatisfaction. This leads to increased costs related to acquiring new customers and lost revenue from existing customers.

## Methodology:  
a. Data Collection: Gather historical data of customer usage data, billing information, service tickets, customer feedback, etc to build a comprehensive dataset.  
b. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data that could influence customer churn. 
d. Model Development: Apply traditional machine learning algorithms, ensemble techniques, and ANN to develop predictive models. Evaluate each model based on performance metrics to select the best approach. 
e. Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for realtime prediction of customer churn using Streamlit.

## Data Sources: 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from IBM. IBM provided customer data for Telco industry to predict behaviour of the customers. 
The dataset consists of 22 fields and 7043 records. The datasets contain information regarding the, 
a. Demographic: gender, age range and if they have any partner or dependent. 
b. Account type: How long they have been a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges. 
c. Service: User has phone or internet service. Also, information related to multiline phone, streaming services and many more.

## Tools and Technologies: 
a. Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, model development, and deployment. 
b. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit learn for machine learning, and Keras for ANN. 
c. Streamlit framework for deployment and Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and documentation.
